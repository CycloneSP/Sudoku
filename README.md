# Sudoku
This is just a simple javascript project I've been working on.
The program generates a completely solved sudoku puzzle, which it then hides random numbers from the player.
The program also features a basic user interface. Empty tiles clicked on by the player will be highlighted and incorrect answers will be show in red.
Refreshing the webpage will generate a new puzzle.

Program includes basic 'note taking' functionality found in most digital versions of sudoku. By clicking the orange button to the left of the sudoku grid, the player can toggle 'note taking' on and off. The button is defaulted to off.

Program also includes timer for tracking the length of time it takes to solve the puzzle, as well as a penalty system for incorrect answers. Penalty is set to increase timer by 30 seconds for each incorrect answer.
