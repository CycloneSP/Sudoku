Javascript Sudoku game
This is just a simple javascript project I've been working on.
The program generates a completely solved sudoku puzzle, then hides random numbers from the player.
The program also features a basic user interface. Empty tiles clicked on by the player will be highlighted and incorrect answers will be show in red.
Refreshing the webpage will generate a new puzzle.
