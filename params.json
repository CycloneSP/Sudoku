Empty tiles clicked on by the player will be highlighted and incorrect answers will be show in red.\r\nRefreshing the webpage will generate a new puzzle.\r\n\r\nProgram includes basic 'note taking' functionality found in most digital versions of sudoku. By clicking the orange button to the left of the sudoku grid, the player can toggle 'note taking' on and off. The button is defaulted to off.\r\n\r\nProgram also includes timer for tracking the length of time it takes to solve the puzzle, as well as a penalty system for incorrect answers. Penalty is set to increase timer by 30 seconds for each incorrect answer.\r\n",
