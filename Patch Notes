Version 1.0:

Basic functionality implemented. Program generates a fully solved puzzle, then randomly hides numbers from the player.
Supports player input for numbers 1-9.
Inputting the number 0 will erase selected tile.

Version 2.0:

Updated the program to include basic 'note taking' functionality found in most digital versions of sudoku. 
By clicking the orange button to the left of the sudoku grid, the player can toggle 'note taking' on and off. 
The button is defaulted to off.

Version 2.1:

Fixed small bug with note taking feature where if the player were to input a number, erase said number, then attempt to input notes in the same tile, no notes would be displayed.
Also improved note taking feature by allowing player to input a number a second time to remove the note for that specific number, instead of requiring the player to 'zero out' the entire tile every time.

Version 3.0:

Added a basic timer to keep allow players to keep track of how long it takes to solve each puzzle.
Included 30 second penalty for inputting wrong answers.
Tweaked colors a bit, lowered alpha levels of given tiles, making the blue less harsh compared to the rest of the game.
Also tweaked mouse detection code for the 'notes' button, as I am encountering an inconsistent bug where the button will not work on some computers but works just fine on others.
